I was too far away to observe what colour Enid Starkie's eyes were; all I remember of her is that she dressed like a matelot, walked like a scrum-half, and had an atrocious French accent
So, briefly: Flaubert teaches you to gaze upon the truth and not blink from its consequences; he teaches you, with Montaigne, to  sleep on the pillow of doubt; he teaches you to dissect out the constituent parts of reality, and to observe that Nature is always a mixture of genres; he teaches you the most exact use of language; he teaches you not to approach a book in search of moral or social pills  literature is not a pharmacopoeia; he teaches the pre-eminence of Truth, Beauty, Feeling and Style
She would have preferred to be a good girl who could move among adults in silence, relying on the common sense of her parent to observe and extinguish any threats to her comfort or susceptibilities
They observe women in their roles as care-givers and caretakers
It may seem natural to assume that the divergences between different European countries, which we now observe in the war phase of the Gulf crisis, will automatically be prolonged in the postwar phase as well
English pennyYour penny dates from the reign of Eadred and Aethelstan (946955 AD); the observe is clearly marked: EADRED REXAs to the coin's value, much depends on the quality of the portrait
The general lack of awareness in the medical profession of the nature of addictive disease and of the process of recovery through the Anonymous Fellowships is Surely, a clinical scientist should observe first, postulate second and treat third, not the other way round
 Open meetings of any of the Anonymous Fellowships are there for all to observe who wish to do so and it is a scientific and academic disgrace that experience of this successful method of treatment for a major disease is not a compulsory (or even an acknowledged) part of standard undergraduate or postgraduate medical curricular
The fundamental requirement of all counselling is the capacity to observe one sown feelings, attitudes and behaviour by having open and honest interchange with others
This collective picture is then reflected back to the sufferer with the recommendation that he or she finds out whether his or her contemporaries in treatment observe the same picture

Once or twice Carolan himself had hinted at the moral justification of force to secure the people's just demands, but he was careful to remain within the law, and when challenged in Parliament would observe loftily that he spoke philosophically, and that he could trust the good sense of the English people to interpret his views correctly
He didn't refer to it directly, but he did observe mildly, You seem to be a power in the City
 79 sign-postsPeople are supposed to observe the sign-posts and obey the instructions
That last, familiar, word was used by Nietzsche himself precisely in this context and at this time: I observe how my philosophical, moral and scholarly endeavours strive towards a single goal and that I may perhaps become the first philologist ever to achieve wholeness
To observe use by simply recording user activity does not provide explanations for user behaviour
To observe searching behaviour solely at the catalogue may provide a distorted picture of the task in hand
Clearly much more work is required on the development of techniques to observe the user during the search activity in order to make the necessary assessments
A common technique for torsion tests is to apply a constant torque (electrically or by pulley wheels) and observe torsional creep
The  ethologists, some of whom prefer to call themselves socio-biologists, endeavour to observe their subjects in the wild, in circumstances where the gadgetry of scientific apparatus will have only minimal consequences for what is going on
Even those who have fully accepted the thesis that all varieties of animal, including man, had a common origin in remote geological time have still managed to believe that a clear-cut distinction may be drawn between the culture of man and the mechanistic responses which we  can observe in the interaction processes of other animals
 In the course of his fieldwork the anthropologist will observe in considerable detail the day-to-day interactions of a few hundred individuals with many of whom he will eventually become intimately acquainted
The logic of the exercise becomes apparent when we observe how the same behavioural detail is used in different ritual contexts
We could still imagine that there is a set of laws that determines events completely for some supernatural being, who could observe the present state of the universe without disturbing it
An important consequence of this is that one can observe what is called interference between two sets of waves or particles
(If, for example, one observed a number of protons equal to 1 followed by thirty-one zeros for a period of one year, one would expect, according to the simplest GUT, to observe more than one proton decay
 Even though it is very difficult to observe spontaneous proton decay, it may be that our very existence is a consequence of the reverse process, the production of protons, or more simply, of quarks, from an initial situation in which there were no more quarks than antiquarks, which is the most natural way to imagine the universe starting out
If there were large regions of anti-matter in our galaxy, we would expect to observe large quantities of radiation from the borders between the regions of matter and antimatter, where many particles would be colliding with their antiparticles, annihilating each other and giving off high energy radiation
But they are all too far away and therefore too difficult to observe to provide conclusive evidence of black holes
We do observe such a background of gamma rays: Fig
With primordial black holes being so scarce, it might seem unlikely that there would be one near enough for us to observe as an individual source of gamma rays
And to observe these few coming from the distance of Pluto would require a larger gamma ray detector than any that have been constructed so far
However, in this case, it would not be necessary to determine that all the quanta came from the same direction: it would be enough to observe that they all arrived within a very short time interval to be reasonably confident that they were coming from the same burst
Unfortunately, their energies nowadays would be too low for us to observe them directly
Predictions made for the proportions of various elements in the early universe were therefore rather inaccurate, but these calculations have been repeated in the light of better knowledge and now agree very well with what we observe
The intelligent beings in these regions should therefore not be surprised if they observe that their locality in the universe satisfies the conditions that are necessary for their existence
One would feel happier about the anthropic principle, at least in its weak version, if one could show that quite a number of different initial configurations for the universe would have evolved to produce a universe like the one we observe
During this period, the initial nonuniformities would have been amplified until they were big enough to explain the origin of the structures we observe around us
This is the explanation of why we observe that the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time point in the same direction
And the reason we observe this thermodynamic arrow to agree with the cosmological arrow is that intelligent beings can exist only in the expanding phase
The other was the publication of a paper by John Schwarz and Mike Green of Queen Mary College, London, that showed that string theory might be able to explain the existence of particles that have a built-in left-handedness, like some of the particles that we observe
There may well be other regions of the universe, or other universes (whatever that may mean), in which all the dimensions are curled up small or in which more than four dimensions are nearly flat, but there would be no intelligent beings in such regions to observe the different number of effective dimensions
We do not yet know whether all the infinities do cancel each other out, or exactly how to relate the waves on the string to the particular types of particle that we observe
Without a shred of evidence he had employed an innuendo when what he should have said was that any normal English person could not but approve of the sight of young English lads in their uniforms, and would naturally pause to observe how they played a game
As we observe from Table 16
 51), were ultimately rebuilt at least twice in masonry, and it is interesting to observe that there was little change in the original property boundaries through to post-Roman times, despite changes in use
Within these changed professional development practices it is possible to observe a managerial shift towards a more sensitive response to the specific circumstances within which changes in schools were expected to take place
Research over the past few years has led me to observe elsewhere (Cartwright, 1984) that in education in general  and arts education is no different in this respect  assessment comes in all forms and guises, and that the type of assessment practised is dependent upon the reasons for its use
 and then we always have a time when the kids perform their pieces to one another, so first of all we as teachers can observe what is going on, and feed in comments to them if they need any  technical help in terms of how to play musical instruments, etcThey're offering a gift, you know the fact that each one is a piece of work, so much has gone into it that it's something very special, and I understand that it's very nerve-wracking for them to offer it, to perform itI would ask the class to say, What was our brief? so the whole class and also the performers focus onto what the brief is in the performance

The central, distinctive idea here is that the rational expectations hypothesis can be seen as imposing restrictions on what we should observe in the world, and so the validity of rational expectations can be tested by testing for the validity of those restrictions
Imagine that we could directly observe a particular person's or group's expectation formed last period of the current period's value of an economic variable
That is, individuals at time t can observe the current market short rate, , and the current market rate on a bond which has maturity date n, 
For that analysis suggests that if aggregate demand shocks are kept to a minimum, ideally at zero, economic agents will be best able to recognize and respond to relative demand shocks even though they do not observe any other current prices than their own
As I have had reason to observe before, the malai medics weren't such bad guys
Instead, we observe two intense   Raman bands, one at 1285 and the other at 1388 cm -1 
The relative abundances of the three species are 9 : 6 : 1 ( , and we often observe two patterns, each of three bands of intensity-ratio 9:6:1 in decreasing frequency-order, as shown in Fig
There will be a series of levels satisfying this criterion, and so we observe a progression, in the frequency of the ion
There are thus different reasons for observing bands without structure, but when we are able to observe vibrational structure, it can be most helpful
Distortion of doubly-degenerate states gives two maxima, but often these are not resolved, and we may only observe a broadening of the band
I am no less interested to observe that, for Eliot, who always seemed unhurried, there is plenty of time could mean a period of not much more than three weeks for reading (the Strachey book being pretty long), writing typing and dispatching: which, given the fact that Spender's book had not arrived, that I was teaching all day and conducting some evening classes, I still consider a tight fit

Clearly much more work is required on the development of techniques to observe the user during the search activity in order to make the necessary assessments
A common technique for torsion tests is to apply a constant torque (electrically or by pulley wheels) and observe torsional creep
The  ethologists, some of whom prefer to call themselves socio-biologists, endeavour to observe their subjects in the wild, in circumstances where the gadgetry of scientific apparatus will have only minimal consequences for what is going on
Even those who have fully accepted the thesis that all varieties of animal, including man, had a common origin in remote geological time have still managed to believe that a clear-cut distinction may be drawn between the culture of man and the mechanistic responses which we  can observe in the interaction processes of other animals
 In the course of his fieldwork the anthropologist will observe in considerable detail the day-to-day interactions of a few hundred individuals with many of whom he will eventually become intimately acquainted
The logic of the exercise becomes apparent when we observe how the same behavioural detail is used in different ritual contexts
We could still imagine that there is a set of laws that determines events completely for some supernatural being, who could observe the present state of the universe without disturbing it
An important consequence of this is that one can observe what is called interference between two sets of waves or particles
(If, for example, one observed a number of protons equal to 1 followed by thirty-one zeros for a period of one year, one would expect, according to the simplest GUT, to observe more than one proton decay
 Even though it is very difficult to observe spontaneous proton decay, it may be that our very existence is a consequence of the reverse process, the production of protons, or more simply, of quarks, from an initial situation in which there were no more quarks than antiquarks, which is the most natural way to imagine the universe starting out
If there were large regions of anti-matter in our galaxy, we would expect to observe large quantities of radiation from the borders between the regions of matter and antimatter, where many particles would be colliding with their antiparticles, annihilating each other and giving off high energy radiation
But they are all too far away and therefore too difficult to observe to provide conclusive evidence of black holes
We do observe such a background of gamma rays: Fig
With primordial black holes being so scarce, it might seem unlikely that there would be one near enough for us to observe as an individual source of gamma rays
And to observe these few coming from the distance of Pluto would require a larger gamma ray detector than any that have been constructed so far
However, in this case, it would not be necessary to determine that all the quanta came from the same direction: it would be enough to observe that they all arrived within a very short time interval to be reasonably confident that they were coming from the same burst
Unfortunately, their energies nowadays would be too low for us to observe them directly
Predictions made for the proportions of various elements in the early universe were therefore rather inaccurate, but these calculations have been repeated in the light of better knowledge and now agree very well with what we observe
The intelligent beings in these regions should therefore not be surprised if they observe that their locality in the universe satisfies the conditions that are necessary for their existence
One would feel happier about the anthropic principle, at least in its weak version, if one could show that quite a number of different initial configurations for the universe would have evolved to produce a universe like the one we observe
During this period, the initial nonuniformities would have been amplified until they were big enough to explain the origin of the structures we observe around us
This is the explanation of why we observe that the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time point in the same direction
And the reason we observe this thermodynamic arrow to agree with the cosmological arrow is that intelligent beings can exist only in the expanding phase
The other was the publication of a paper by John Schwarz and Mike Green of Queen Mary College, London, that showed that string theory might be able to explain the existence of particles that have a built-in left-handedness, like some of the particles that we observe
There may well be other regions of the universe, or other universes (whatever that may mean), in which all the dimensions are curled up small or in which more than four dimensions are nearly flat, but there would be no intelligent beings in such regions to observe the different number of effective dimensions
We do not yet know whether all the infinities do cancel each other out, or exactly how to relate the waves on the string to the particular types of particle that we observe
Without a shred of evidence he had employed an innuendo when what he should have said was that any normal English person could not but approve of the sight of young English lads in their uniforms, and would naturally pause to observe how they played a game
As we observe from Table 16
 51), were ultimately rebuilt at least twice in masonry, and it is interesting to observe that there was little change in the original property boundaries through to post-Roman times, despite changes in use
Within these changed professional development practices it is possible to observe a managerial shift towards a more sensitive response to the specific circumstances within which changes in schools were expected to take place
Research over the past few years has led me to observe elsewhere (Cartwright, 1984) that in education in general  and arts education is no different in this respect  assessment comes in all forms and guises, and that the type of assessment practised is dependent upon the reasons for its use
 and then we always have a time when the kids perform their pieces to one another, so first of all we as teachers can observe what is going on, and feed in comments to them if they need any  technical help in terms of how to play musical instruments, etcThey're offering a gift, you know the fact that each one is a piece of work, so much has gone into it that it's something very special, and I understand that it's very nerve-wracking for them to offer it, to perform itI would ask the class to say, What was our brief? so the whole class and also the performers focus onto what the brief is in the performance
This describes the forms in which we observe mathematics in calculations, proofs and standard methods
Whatever its origin, however, there will at any time be some such ratio which banks will wish to observe

In each subsequent time period player A, and its opponent in that period B t , observe x, then choose  and  respectively
That is, they observe a sequence  and using this must estimate a value for z
The central, distinctive idea here is that the rational expectations hypothesis can be seen as imposing restrictions on what we should observe in the world, and so the validity of rational expectations can be tested by testing for the validity of those restrictions
Imagine that we could directly observe a particular person's or group's expectation formed last period of the current period's value of an economic variable
That is, individuals at time t can observe the current market short rate, , and the current market rate on a bond which has maturity date n, 
For that analysis suggests that if aggregate demand shocks are kept to a minimum, ideally at zero, economic agents will be best able to recognize and respond to relative demand shocks even though they do not observe any other current prices than their own
As I have had reason to observe before, the malai medics weren't such bad guys
Instead, we observe two intense   Raman bands, one at 1285 and the other at 1388 cm -1 
The relative abundances of the three species are 9 : 6 : 1 ( , and we often observe two patterns, each of three bands of intensity-ratio 9:6:1 in decreasing frequency-order, as shown in Fig
There will be a series of levels satisfying this criterion, and so we observe a progression, in the frequency of the ion
There are thus different reasons for observing bands without structure, but when we are able to observe vibrational structure, it can be most helpful
Distortion of doubly-degenerate states gives two maxima, but often these are not resolved, and we may only observe a broadening of the band
I am no less interested to observe that, for Eliot, who always seemed unhurried, there is plenty of time could mean a period of not much more than three weeks for reading (the Strachey book being pretty long), writing typing and dispatching: which, given the fact that Spender's book had not arrived, that I was teaching all day and conducting some evening classes, I still consider a tight fit

One might have suspected them of being adverbs that simply lacked the ordinary morphological marking, as in: (12) Grandmother took the corner too fast However, one can conclusively show that this is not so by finding examples where the predicate qualifiers fill a position which can also be occupied by a true adverb; here we observe that the effect is strikingly different
We close with a cautionary note: one should bear in mind that a source of potential confusion always present is the fact that certain verbs lend themselves to occurrence with more than one type of adjectival construction, and to illustrate let us observe that any of the following, with their different modes of interpretation, are fully acceptable sentences of English:  (72) Mackay preferred the picture stolen (postnominal attributive) (73) Shelagh prefers her holidays adventurous (predicate qualifier) (74) we prefer the king (to be) beheaded (clausal)This endnote is concerned with some unimportant points of detail concerning example (46)

 Suppose that, for some block, we observe (in arbitrary units): Factorial experiments are very efficient, since each experimental unit is used in the estimation of every main effect and interaction
Can we establish such units and contrasts in intonation?To summarise what was said above, we want to know the answers to two questions about English speech:What can we observe when we study pitch variations?What is the linguistic importance of the phenomena we observe?i)ii)We will begin by looking at intonation in the shortest piece of speech we can find  the single syllable
Recently-developed, safer X-ray techniques can help us to observe articulatory movements taking place within the vocal tract, and contact between the tongue and the palate can be measured electrically
Many companies use role playing as a method of providing new salespeople with the opportunity to develop their skills in a situation where sales trainees can observe and correct behaviour
They wish her good luck and observe ruefully that Sussex's loss will be Cornwall's gain
Would you be happy for Britain, European partners and the Americans to recognise Lithuania's independence while at the same time saying look don't take it out on Russians who are living within your borders, observe human rights and all the rest of it, is, is that our affairs, and our business?All of that was sorted out and agreed and that's the way to progress in these matters
I think those are the sorts of differences I observe and they're not to do with whether I'm a protestant or a Catholic, but what kind of human being I am almost
How do teachers learn to distinguish between behaviour problems associated with learning difficulties and behaviour problems linked to a different set of disorders?Then, says Bob Brooks, teachers must observe the quality of the child's classroom response
There is an uncertainty in the sense that we today observe the universe to be in a state of expansion, that is the most distant galaxies and clusters and galaxies are all receding from one another at a high speed, which actually increases as you look farther and farther away from us
One thing worth remarking about this is cosmology and astronomy in general is very unusual science in the sense that when we observe very distant objects in the universe we are observing the universe actually as it was in the past, because the light that's coming towards us from a distant galaxy or cluster of galaxies actually left that object maybe millions or billions of years ago
So when we say we want the laws of physics perhaps to stay constant in time, when we observe these objects a long way away we're observing the laws of physics as they were a long time ago
Well  I'm not I'm not prepared to accept that any more than I am prepared to accept the hogwash that we heard from Bob Morgan and his Liberal Democrats , because of course it may be extremely comfortable for him to be acting like a beached dolphin on the shores of Abu Dhabi, but the fact of the matter is, of course, that the Liberal Democrats, with or without the backs of their envelopes and cigarettes packets, are extremely unlikely to be making any national legislation, so they are quite comfortable in being able to observe how others might or might not do it
Really I think I am able to demonstrate in a written account of the research that I am presenting a very real account of their teaching and their problems, as well as their successes erm sometimes I was able to observe lessons that went wrong and were very erm difficult for the teachers, as well as the lessons that were successful, so I don't really think it  the problems at the end
